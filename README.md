# Bootstrap-Portfolio

In this assignment, we are recreating our earlier work on our first portfolio using bootstrap. 
There is a navigation bar which has link of "About", "Portfolio", and "Contact". When the user hover each one of 
these links and click on each one, it will direct the user to the desired page. 
The header and the footer (sticky) are in fixed position and will be static eventhough the page is scrolled down. 
I first went to the getbootstrap website and search for template that closely resemble the required pages. 
Then, I copied the codes and paste them in my working files. Then the process of eliminating unwanted codes began.
Additonal tweekings also needs to be made in the css files to correspond to the changes in the html files.
